The Table History Project is designed to make sense of the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s public API by tracking the history of its tables. Normally, if you want to know when a table first appeared, disappeared, or how its description has changed over time, youâ€™d have to dig through dataset after dataset manually. Thatâ€™s time-consuming and error-prone.

This project solves that by using Python to automatically access Census API endpoints across all available years. The program collects details about each tableâ€”such as when it first appeared, the years itâ€™s missing, and how its name or description has evolved. The result isnâ€™t just raw data: the goal is to produce an HTML page (or set of linked pages) that lets you search for a table ID like B18104 and instantly see its full history at a glance.

Weâ€™re working with both ACS 1-year and 5-year datasets to ensure the information is thorough and reliable. The big idea is to save researchers, analysts, and anyone interested in Census data from repetitive manual workâ€”turning table history into a tool thatâ€™s easy to use and explore.

Welcome aboard! Weâ€™re excited to have you here, and your contributions will help make this vision a reality.
